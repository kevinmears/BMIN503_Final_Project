# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are infections that occur while receiving healthcare or shortly after leaving the hospital. 
Many factors influence the risks of HAIs including length of stay, co-morbidities, and disinfection practices. 
The goal of this project was to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on common hospital-acquired infections in 2020.
